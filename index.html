This increadibly rare was filmed off the coast of jamica by Leo van Toly,the footage shows the white whale swimming through the blue waters of the carribian sea.
white whales were popularized by american novelist Herman Melvilles epic novel moby dick.
<br>
According to the Gaurdian, A white whale is always not albino, some of the sperm whales have a rare condition called leucisim an irregular distribution of melanin pigment in the skin can affect the animal. Leucism can be found in other animals as well like common crow, orcas, or dolphins. The report stated that pink eyes are the features of true albino animals, but since the recent footage was taken from a distance,
 it is difficult to diagnose the white sperm whale's exact condition.
<br>
Sperm whales are generally black, grey or even brown in color.Speaking to the guardian Hal whitehead, Expert at sperm whales told “I don't think I've ever seen a fully white sperm whale. I have seen ones with quite a lot of white on them, usually in patches on and near the belly.”
Sperm whales, which can reach 18 metres in length, have the largest teeth of any animal. They also boast the biggest brain, use different dialects in their communicative clicks from one group to another and possess an intergenerational culture that is passed on matrilineally.

Their sense of social expression and cohesion defines them: one feels this when in the water with them, as their sonorous clicks permit them to communicate with one another over great distances. This highly unusual sighting of an almost heraldic beast speaks to the paradoxical fragility of whales - the largest animals on earth, yet whose fates we hold in our hands.
